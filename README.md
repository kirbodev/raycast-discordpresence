# Discord Presence

Set your Discord rich presence from Raycast

## Requirements

- A Discord application

You need a [Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to use the extension. The name of the extension will be the name as the activity and the image will be used as the large image by default. You can set the application ID in the extension preferences.

## Quick start

Install the require dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the extension

```bash
npm run build
```

## Windows Only

I don't have a mac to test the extension on so I can't publish it to the Raycast store. If you want to use it, you can install it from the source code.
It should work fine since it doesn't use any mac specific features to my knowledge.
